Problem 3:

Pair of Numbers
----------------
Simon has an array a1, a2, ..., an, consisting of n positive integers.
Today Simon asked you to find a pair of integers l, r (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n), such that the following conditions hold:

1. there is integer j (l ≤ j ≤ r), such that all integers al, al + 1, ..., ar are divisible by aj;
2. value r - l takes the maximum value among all pairs for which condition 1 is true;

Help Simon, find the required pair of numbers (l, r). If there are multiple required pairs find all of them.

Input:
The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3*10^5).
The second line contains n space-separated integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^6).

Output:
Print two integers in the first line — the number of required pairs and the maximum value of r - l.
On the following line print all l values from optimal pairs in increasing order.
