CS 293
Graded Lab 1
---------------
This lab has 4 questions. Each has been described in a separate file.
The testcases provided to you are only minimal and the testcases on which
your code will be tested will be different. Please see the required time
complexities for each problem.
You are expected to follow the correct input and output format.

Weightages for the problems are as follows:
Problem 1 - 2 Marks
Problem 2 - 2 Marks
Problem 3 - 3 marks
Problem 4 - 3 Marks
-------------------
Total     - 10 Marks

Note:
1. You have to follow the correct submission format and file names. No marks will be given otherwise.
2. Your code will be evaluated on the basis of testcases and also by reading through your code to see
if the guidelines have been followed properly.
3. All forms of academic dishonesty will be dealt with very seriously (both in the graded and ungraded labs).
