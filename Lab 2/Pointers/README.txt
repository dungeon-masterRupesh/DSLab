Data Structures and Algorithms Lab

Lab 2 - Task 3
-------------------


This task is meant as a C++ refresher and asks you to
implement a simple functionality within a class. The class
specification is provided --- basically, a class file that
initializes and stores a "String" and provides some custom
functionality.


The provided files are: String.h 
You should implement: String.cpp


The lab has a set of exercises that incrementally tests 
the specified functionality of each member function.
You should check your implementation against each
of the exercise testcases.


The exercise testcases are labeled t1, t2 etc. and are
stored in separate directories.
Each exercise directory has a main program and a file to
show representative expected output of the program.
(Note that you are not supposed to write the main program)


Note: The exercise testcases are only meant to test your
implementation for the provided programs. Separate testcases
will be used to check actual correctness and handling of corner
cases etc.
